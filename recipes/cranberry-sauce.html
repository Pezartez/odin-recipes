<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It is unclear to me how the canned version of this dish came to be so prevalent. The stove-top version is one of the lowest stress-items to make for a holiday dinner and easily becomes one of the highlights of the meal. It brings out the best in any main dish you are serving it with, whether that's turkey or a delicious vegan vegetable medley, or anything in between.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bag of fresh cranberries</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 dashes cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>3 cloves</li>
        <li>1 orange (for zest)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On medium heat, pour cranberries into a pot and add sugar.</li>
        <li>Stirring occaisionally, check to see when the sugar has melted and the cranberries start to burst. Reduce heat to low, add the cinnamon, star anise and cloves and continue to cook.</li>
        <li>After about 15 minutes, remove from heat and carefully remove the star anise and cloves. Finish with a zest of orange!</li>
    </ol>
