<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It is unclear to me how the canned version of this dish came to be so prevalent. The stove-top version is one of the lowest stress-items to make for a holiday dinner and easily becomes one of the highlights of the meal. It brings out the best in any main dish you are serving it with, whether that's turkey or a delicious vegan vegetable medley, or anything in between.</p>
