<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I first served these pears a couple of years ago. Since then, they have been requested each time! This is a dish that can quietly cook on the stove while you go about and enjoy other parts of your evening. I originally thought to serve them as a dessert, but they actually aren't too sweet and made a great side dish.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine (box is ok)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>2 star anise</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>4 whole bosc pears - with stems attached</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pot with deep sides, pour in wine, sugar and spices and set to medium heat</li>
        <li>While the wine mixture is heating up, carefully skin all four of the pears. Place them in the wine mixture, setting them so the wine comes up as high as possible on the pears.</li>
        <li>Once at a boil, turn down to a simmer and cook until pears are tender - close to an hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the pears using a slotted spoon, then continue to cook the wine and spices, reducing down to a thin syrup. Serve with the pears. Enjoy!</li>
